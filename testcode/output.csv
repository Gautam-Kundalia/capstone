The Behavioral Crossroads team dressed in purple shirts this month to mark “Wear Purple Day” as part of Alcohol Awareness Month. This is a time to raise awareness and understanding of alcohol misuse. Alcohol-related deaths are increasing in the United States and alcohol is the most prevalent substance involved in substance-related emergency department visits.

According to the 2022 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), conducted annually by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), there were 137.4 million current alcohol users aged 12 or older. Of the current alcohol users, 61.2 million people (or 44.5 percent) were binge drinkers, and 16.1 million people (or 11.7 percent) were heavy drinkers. 29.5 million people aged 12 and older met the applicable DSM-5 criteria for having an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the past year. This includes 17.4 million males aged 12 and older and 12.2 million females aged 12 and older.

Studies indicate that drinking can interfere with normal brain development. Drinking is also associated with decreased school performance, increased involvement with the legal system, use of other substances, and greater risk of injuries, including death from motor vehicle crashes.

If you’ve been drinking to excess while knowing that it’s causing problems in the rest of your life, but you can’t seem to stop, the chances are you’re suffering from an alcohol use disorder. The first thing to realize is that you are not alone. There are people who can help you with the struggle you’re facing. With professional guidance, therapy and a support network that understands what you’re going through, you can make the changes necessary to get back on track to a happy, healthy life.
